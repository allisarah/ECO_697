# For today

\vfill

Today is all about polygon concepts!

Wednesday:

- Examples in R




# Concepts

\vfill
- What are polygons?

\vfill
- How do they differ from other data types we've looked at?





# Concepts

What are polygons?

- Vector data structures.

\vfill
How do the differ from other data types we've looked at?

- Convey a sense of **area**.
    - Landscape composition.
    - How is this different than raster data?
- Lossless transformations*
    - Why?
- Convey a sense of **shape**.
    - Landscape configuration
- They have definite borders, insides, and outsides.



# Concepts

\vfill
- What do **grain** and **extent** mean in a polygon world?

\vfill
- What is a **convex** polygon?

\vfill
- What is a **convex hull**?


# Concepts

\vfill
- What sorts of questions do polygons suggest and/or answer?

\vfill
- How are these similar/different from other geographic data types?




# Concepts: Challenges and Opportunities

Relative to other geographic data types, what are some advantages of polygon data?

- What are some advantages of polygon data?
- What are some challenges?



# Concepts: Opportunities

Relative to other geographic data types, what are some advantages of polygon data?

- Potentially richer data source
  - Provide shape information.
  - Provide landscape configuration information.



# Concepts: Challenges
\vfill
Relative to other geographic data types, what are some challenges?

- Potentially poorer data source: delocalization
- Boundaries can give false sense of confidence
- Borders may hide, or even misrepresent important phenomena.
- Political borders vs. population, ethnic, economic, other realities.
- Computational complexity: computational geometry




# Polygons: representations in R (and other GISs)

\vfill
Two main R packages:  `sp` and `sf`.

- Use some of the same c code under the hood.
- `sf` (Simple Features) is newer.
- `sf` (Simple Features) is an ISO standard.
- Individual polygons: set of **vertices**.
- Projection information




# Polygons: representations in R (and other GISs)
\vfill
Sets of polygons: 

- `SpatialPolygons*` objects
- `sf` objects
    
\vfill
Set of polygon **attributes**.

- variables
- `sp` uses `data.frame` objects.
- `sf` uses `tibble` objects.
  



# Polygons: Distance and Configuration

\vfill
What does **distance** mean in a polygon context?

- Which two distance types did we use for point data?

Polygon Neighborhoods:

- first degree
- second degree

How could we quantify **shape**?




# Polygons: Distance and Configuration

What does **distance** mean in a polygon context?

- centroid distance
- minimum edge/vertex distance
- edge and vertex continuity

Neighborhoods:

- first degree: share an edge
- second degree: shares an edge with a first degree neighbor

How could we quantify **shape**?

- area, perimeter
- perimeter/area ratio
- fractal dimension




# Polygon Manipulations

What might we want to do with polygons?




# Polygon Manipulations

\vfill
Classic GIS operations:

- Buffers
- Intersections
- Unions
- Type inter conversion




# Polygon Operations

\vfill
- Point-in-polygon queries
- Calculate centroids
- Tessellations
- Data type conversions:
    - polygon to raster
    - point to raster
    - line to raster
    - raster to polygon



# Disaggregation
\vfill
- What is it?



# Disaggregation

\vfill
- A kind of **masking**
    - Focal Area, Moving window
    - Simple area weighting
    - Mask area weighting



# Disaggregation

# Polygons can be dirty!

What could go wrong with polygons?




# Polygons can be dirty!

Edges of neighboring polygons may be slightly different

- mis-recorded
- round-off errors
- error propagation

Self-intersections

- big problem for computational geometry

Rasterizing/polygonizing operations are complicated and/or lossy.

Projections: area, distance, shape 



# Examples

Gerrymandering

- How could polygon analysis address gerrymandering?




# School segregation:  Natural attendance zone
\vfill
- How could polygon analysis address gerrymandering?
- Compare demographics in Voronoi-tessellated school zones and political school zones.




# School segregation:  Natural attendance zone
\vfill
Voronoi considerations:

- Voronoi polygons are not weighted by population
- Minimizes Euclidean distance, but not necessarily travel time
- Do not consider physical barriers: rivers, mountains, etc.
- Insensitive to political borders



# School segregation:  Natural attendance zone
\vfill
- Simpson diversity quantified in real school attendance district
- Simpson diversity quantified in Voronoi attendance district
- Real/Voronoi ratio


# School segregation:  Natural attendance zone
